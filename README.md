# exon_array_data_analysis
The project involves analyzing exon array data from drug-treated (clorimazole, flunarizine,chlorhexidine) cells obtained from GEO. 
The CEL files were obtained from the database and run in APT to obtain gene, exon and dabg values. The data was checked for outliers and compared between various groups to find differentially expressed exons.
